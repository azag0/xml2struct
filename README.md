This small mex function converts an XML file into a MATLAB structure. 
It can parse any general XML file and with a proper mark-up and strucure, 
It can additionally read general n-dimensional arrays.

For compilation of the C++ mex file, run `make BOOST=<path>` where `<path>` is 
a path to the Boost library include files.

**TODO**: Remove Boost dependency. It's here because of a single string function and absolutely should be gone.

To run a test and see how `test.xml` gets converted, run `make test`. It should 
output
