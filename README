This small mex function converts an XML file into a MATLAB structure. 

Requirements on the XML file:
* All XML attributes are ignored.
* An element can contain either (i) a single number or (ii) only other elements.
* If there are more than one children of the same name in an element, they have to be of type (ii) and they have to have the same internal structure.
